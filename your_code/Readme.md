## Project Description
This is the first small project in my journey with Iron Hack data analytics bootcamp. It is about building a game, for which the intention is to apply all the basic python skills we learned in the first week of the progam. 
I have chosen the game **Solitaire**, which is at a moderate level of difficulty. There is no specific reason why I have selected it, except for that I perhaps like a bit of a challenge.

## Rules
Most of the rules are retained from the original game. For more info on that, refer to the following [link](https://www.solitr.com).

Due to time constraint, I have made the following adaptations to the rules, to make the project more achievable:
1. The cards range from 1 to 13; thus:
    * 1 = Ace
    * 11 = J
    * 12 = Q
    * 13 = K
2. The stock pile:
    * only one card is visible at a time
    * upon starting the game, one card will already be made visible
    * it cannot be moved directly from the stock pile to any of the foundations
3. The tableaus:
    * When moving cards from one tableau to another, it is possible only to move the whole of all the visible cards on the move-from tableau
4. The foundations:
    * Foundations are numbered 1-2-3-4 from left to right
    * The foundations are designated for specific card types as follows:
        ** Foundation 1 = ♥
        ** Foundation 2 = ♦
        ** Foundation 3 = ♠
        ** Foundation 4 = ♣

## Workflow
